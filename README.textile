#Render code written in F#.
The point of this branch is to implement different optimization methods in order to reduce the time searching for intersections.

It can manage:
- Extended lights added as a circular light - directionality added.
- Works with a Sphere type and meshes .obj type simplified
- Multiple reflexions and transmissions included
- Fresnel reflexion term can be used
- Bounding Box implemented to reduce computing time
- Space partitioning implement, BBox of elements in a partition optimized/Redefined. (Test script not good to partitionate)
- Added in the space partitioning technniques an Octree structure (test with an scene of 50000 triangles)
- Parallel implementation throught async F# on BBox and on pixel initialization. Up to now on the initialization only creates 4 procces and cannot be modified. Great Speed-up obtained.

Octree Test with 50k triangles:

Currently this scene is on program.fs
The computing time was: *Real: 02:31:33.620, CPU: 07:48:39.953*

Previous example with an extended light illuminating the scene:

Script: Test_PreProcessorGrid.fsx - Just comment that this example is not really faster with the space partitioning due to the bounding of the world

Script: Test_AllScene_ExtendedSource.fsx


Simple ForwardRayTracing implemented on Test_ForwardRay.fsx and Sensor.fs
The two nect cases have been tested:

The local Paths of the .obj mesh files must be changed on the script and on the program.fs,I don't know (yet) how to specify the local  path.
